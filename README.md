### Project 1 Analysis

After the completion of the project we played around with the parameters and found some interesting results. While having the maximum initial distance, initial velocity, acceleration and deceleration, the main factor that contributed to the result was the length of the yellow sign. If the length was under approximately 3 seconds then the width of the intersection had to be approximately 25m in order for the car to be able to accelerate past the crossroad. However, if the light duration was low enough(deltaT ~ 0.4s) then the result would turn from impossible to deceleration. Some obvious results were that if the acceleration or deceleration were not enough for the covered distance then the driver would be driving illegally(hence impossible result). Another obvious result was that if the initial speed wasn't high enough, most of the time(with minimal distance from intersection, max acceleration) the result would be to decelerate. Logical as it would take more time to aquire the needed velocity to legally pass the crossroad. The result based on these sets of parameters though needs the deceleration to be at least 2.05m/s^2 otherwise the car, is again, driving illegally.
